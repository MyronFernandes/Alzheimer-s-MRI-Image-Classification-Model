# Alzheimer-s-MRI-Image-Classification-Model
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, a condition that leads to cognitive decline and difficulty in daily activities. Over time, Alzheimer’s damages brain cells, leading to brain shrinkage and loss of function.
## How Can Alzheimer's Be Predicted Using MRI Images? ##
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a powerful tool for detecting Alzheimer's disease by analyzing brain structure and identifying abnormalities. AI models, particularly deep learning techniques, help in predicting Alzheimer’s through MRI by detecting patterns that indicate the disease.
