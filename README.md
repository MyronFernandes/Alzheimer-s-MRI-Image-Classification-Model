Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, a condition that leads to cognitive decline and difficulty in daily activities. Over time, Alzheimer’s damages brain cells, leading to brain shrinkage and loss of function.
