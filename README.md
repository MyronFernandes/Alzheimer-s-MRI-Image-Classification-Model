# Alzheimer-s-MRI-Image-Classification-Model
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, a condition that leads to cognitive decline and difficulty in daily activities. Over time, Alzheimer’s damages brain cells, leading to brain shrinkage and loss of function.
## How Can Alzheimer's Be Predicted Using MRI Images? ##
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a powerful tool for detecting Alzheimer's disease by analyzing brain structure and identifying abnormalities. AI models, particularly deep learning techniques, help in predicting Alzheimer’s through MRI by detecting patterns that indicate the disease.
## Conclusion
We found that the custom convolutional net outperformed. However, the lack of 'Moderate Demented' images proved to be troublesome. Augmentation was considered, however due to the nature of Alzheimers, altering the images could change the class and was considered too risky to achieve. Regardless, the custom convolutional net achieved fairly satisfactory results in good time, but overfit a bit. Further optimisation would be required before deployment. Future steps would include gathering more data, gaining more domain knowledge to learn ways to make more use of our current data as well as hyperpareameter tuning. A user-friendly interface for deployment could be considered as an extension as well.
The early stopping technique helped prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data. By stopping training at the optimal point, the model maintained high accuracy on the test set while avoiding unnecessary complexity. This approach improved the reliability of Alzheimer’s MRI classification, making it more effective for real-world applications.
